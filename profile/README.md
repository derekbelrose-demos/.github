# Derek Belrose Demos

## What?
This is a simple GitHub organization for me to setup and demo certain organization features such as shared GHA workflows, shared issue templates and other things.

## Who
This is really just intended for me to show to clients but feel free to reuse this as you like. Anyone!  Really!  It's unlicensed because I don't own this knowledge, I've learned it from others and I'd rather see people learn from my endeavors.
